# Mastering CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool for creating complex web layouts with ease. It provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that revolutionizes how we design web pages.

## Getting Started with CSS Grid

To create a grid container, you simply need to set the `display` property to `grid`:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* Three equal columns */
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Two rows with specific heights */
  gap: 20px; /* Gap between grid items */
}
```

## Defining Grid Columns and Rows

You can define your grid structure using various units:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  
  /* Fixed units */
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 100px;
  
  /* Fractional units */
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  
  /* Mixed units */
  grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 2fr;
  
  /* Auto-fill and auto-fit */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}
```

The `fr` unit represents a fraction of the available space, making it incredibly useful for responsive designs.

## Placing Items on the Grid

You can place items precisely on your grid using the following properties:

```css
.item {
  /* Specific grid lines */
  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Start at line 1, end at line 3 */
  grid-row: 2 / 4; /* Start at line 2, end at line 4 */
  
  /* Span a number of tracks */
  grid-column: span 2; /* Span 2 columns */
  grid-row: span 3; /* Span 3 rows */
  
  /* Named grid areas */
  grid-area: header; /* Place in the named "header" area */
}
```

## Creating Named Grid Areas

You can name areas of your grid for more intuitive placement:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header"
    "sidebar content content"
    "footer footer footer";
}

.header { grid-area: header; }
.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
.content { grid-area: content; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }
```

This creates a classic layout with a header, sidebar, content area, and footer.

## Alignment in CSS Grid

CSS Grid provides powerful alignment capabilities:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  
  /* Align all items horizontally */
  justify-items: center; /* start | end | center | stretch */
  
  /* Align all items vertically */
  align-items: center; /* start | end | center | stretch */
  
  /* Align the entire grid horizontally within its container */
  justify-content: space-between; /* start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly */
  
  /* Align the entire grid vertically within its container */
  align-content: space-between; /* start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly */
}

.item {
  /* Override alignment for a specific item */
  justify-self: end;
  align-self: start;
}
```

## Responsive Grids with minmax() and auto-fit

One of the most powerful features of CSS Grid is creating responsive layouts without media queries:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates a responsive grid where each column is at least 250px wide, and columns will automatically adjust to fill the available space.

## Grid vs. Flexbox

While CSS Grid is perfect for two-dimensional layouts, Flexbox is still ideal for one-dimensional layouts:

- Use **Grid** for overall page layout and complex two-dimensional structures
- Use **Flexbox** for alignment within a row or column, or for simpler one-dimensional layouts

Often, the best approach is to use both: Grid for the overall layout, and Flexbox for alignment within grid areas.

## Browser Support

CSS Grid is supported in all modern browsers. For older browsers, you can use feature detection and provide fallbacks:

```css
@supports (display: grid) {
  .container {
    display: grid;
    /* Grid properties */
  }
}

@supports not (display: grid) {
  .container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    /* Flexbox fallback */
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

CSS Grid has transformed how we approach web layout. By mastering these concepts, you'll be able to create complex, responsive layouts with clean, semantic HTML and minimal CSS. The best way to learn is by experimenting, so try building different layouts to solidify your understanding.
