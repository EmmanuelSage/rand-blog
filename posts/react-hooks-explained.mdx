# React Hooks Explained

React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to use state and other React features without writing a class. They allow you to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Why Hooks?

Hooks solve several problems in React:

1. **Reusing stateful logic** between components without render props or higher-order components
2. **Splitting complex components** into smaller functions based on related pieces
3. **Using React features without classes**, which can be confusing with `this` binding

## Common Hooks

### useState

The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useContext

The `useContext` hook lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting:

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from './theme-context';

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.foreground }}>
      I am styled by theme context!
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Test Your Knowledge

Let's test your understanding of React Hooks:

  question="Which of the following is NOT a built-in React Hook?"
  options={[
    { id: '1', text: 'useState', isCorrect: false },
    { id: '2', text: 'useEffect', isCorrect: false },
    { id: '3', text: 'useComponent', isCorrect: true },
    { id: '4', text: 'useContext', isCorrect: false }
  ]}
  explanation="useComponent is not a built-in React Hook. The core hooks include useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useCallback, useMemo, useRef, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, and useDebugValue."

## Rules of Hooks

There are two important rules to follow when using Hooks:

1. **Only call Hooks at the top level** - Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Only call Hooks from React function components** - Don't call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own Hooks to reuse stateful logic between components. A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with "use" and that may call other Hooks.

Here's a simple example of a custom Hook:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    };
  }, []);
  
  return width;
}
```

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a more direct API to React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. They make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components and make your code more readable and maintainable.

Start using Hooks in your new components, and gradually migrate your existing components when it makes sense for your team.
